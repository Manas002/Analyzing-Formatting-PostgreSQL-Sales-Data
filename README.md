In this project, we will work with data from a hypothetical Super Store to challenge and enhance your SQL skills in data cleaning. This project will engage you in identifying top categories based on the highest profit margins and detecting missing values, utilizing your comprehensive knowledge of SQL concepts.

**Questions answered:**

**1- Find the top 5 products from each category based on highest total sales.**

**2- Calculate the quantity for orders with missing values in the quantity column by determining the unit price for each product_id using available order data, considering relevant pricing factors such as discount, market, or region.**
