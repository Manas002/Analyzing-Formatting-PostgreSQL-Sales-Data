In this project, we will work with data from a hypothetical Super Store to challenge and enhance your SQL skills in data cleaning. This project will engage you in identifying top categories based on the highest profit margins and detecting missing values, utilizing your comprehensive knowledge of SQL concepts.

**Questions answered:**

**1- Find the top 5 products from each category based on highest total sales.**
The output should be sorted by category in ascending order and by sales in descending order within each category, i.e. within each category product with highest margin should sit on the top. Save the       query as top_five_products_each_category

**2- Calculate the quantity for orders with missing values in the quantity column by determining the unit price for each product_id using available order data, considering relevant pricing factors such as discount, market, or region.**
Then, use this unit price to estimate the missing quantity values. The calculated values should be stored in the calculated_quantity column. Save query output as impute_missing_values
